# Overview

## Introduction

Data science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data, often very large quantities of data. It includes data acquisition and import, tidying, visualisation, analysis and communication and can be applied to complex problems in any domain of biology and beyond, with data generated from, for example, images, all types of 'omic' technologies, monitoring devices, publications and social media. Critically evaluating such analyses, the reliability of inferences made and advancing methodology efficiently is dependent on research being open and reproducible. This option will allow you to develop skills required to openly and reproducibly acquire, analyse and communicate data in your own field. You will learn how to organise and document analyses efficiently and use RMarkdown for "literate programming" to create fully reproducible documents. You will also learn some widely used machine learning methods. The assessment has flexibility and you can either work with a provided dataset or one of your own choosing.

Requirements: Experience of R equivalent to BIO00017C / BIO00008C and  BIO00058I

Each topic will start with some independent study in the form of written material and short videos including worked examples. There will then be an online workshop in which you will work in groups or 3-4 on topic problems. You will take it in turn to share your screen and will all work on the same 'repository' collaboratively.

## Assessment
2000 word report

The summative assessment is through the statistical and quantitative problem solving used in the Experimental Design and Bioscience Techniques options you do.

Chosen topics are: foundational, follow stages 1 and 2 well, are widely applicable (in this module and beyond) and transferable conceptually:

1. Using RStudio projects and an emphasis on good practice in code and project documentation and organisation including version control and collaboration.  
2. More advanced data tidying.  
3. An emphasis on reproducibility and reproducible reporting using R Markdown.  
4. Some machine learning concepts and methods that are very commonly applied independent of the data domain.  

You will have the time and opportunity to independently develop skills particular to your interests and the assessment undertaken with support.

* Topic 1: Project organisation. Tools for version control and collaborating
* Topic 2: Tidying data and the tidyverse.
* Topic 3:  Reproducibility and an introduction to R Markdown.
* Topic 4:  Advanced R Markdown.
* Topic 5:  An introduction to Machine Learning: Overview and Unsupervised methods
* Topic 6:  An introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Methods
