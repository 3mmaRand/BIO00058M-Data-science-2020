# Aims & Learning Outcomes

# Aims & Learning Outcomes

The aim of the 58M module is to enable you to to develop skills in some specific types of ‘data analysis’ by providing supported practice in workshops and opportunities to apply them independently in ‘projects’.

--

There three options: Data Science, Sequence Analysis, Using 3D structures of macromolecules

--

At the end of this module the successful student will be able to:
1. Demonstrate the acquisition of skills in experimental design and data analysis, related to the option chosen within the module.
2. Apply the skills learned to address novel bioscience problems.

---
# Learning Outcomes of Data Science

For Data Science, the first objective means:

**Produce a reproducible data analysis and report. **

The analysis can emphasise data import, processing, statistical analysis, visualisation or any combination of these.

# Survey Results

# What is Data Science?

---
# What is Data Science?

The development, and application, of reproducible workflows for the simulation, collection, organisation, processing, analysis and presentation of data in order to extract knowledge or insight.

Data science underlies open and reproducible research.

--

How much of data science is using statistics?

Less than you probably think

~80% of your time working and reporting on data reproducibly outside of statistical analysis.

# Reproducibility is key!

One definition
*"... obtaining consistent results using the same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis. This definition is synonymous with “computational reproducibility"*. `r Cite(myBib, "National_Academies_of_Sciences_Engineering2019-sb")`

# Rationale for scripting analysis

# Rationale for scripting analysis
We ensure reproducibility of laboratory and field work by planning and recording in lab books and using standard protocols. 


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}

Even so replicating results can be hard.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../pics/rationale3.png")

Workflows for computational projects and the data analysis and reporting of other work can, and should, be 100% reproducible! Scripting is the way to achieve this.

---

# Rationale for scripting analysis

That reproducibility applies to all aspects of the data workflow.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../pics/rationale5.png")
```

--

From importing or collecting the data, processing it for analysis, building statistical models and communicating the methods and results.

--

These are usually iterative and that process of iteration (the development of the analysis) should also be captured.

# Why R?


---
# Why R?

Open source and free

--
 .......But so is Python
  
--

R has reputation for catering to users who do not see themselves as programmers, and  allowing them to slide gradually into programming.


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../pics/biologist1.png")
```


--

Designed for data analysis and graphics - which means it is often easier to achieve those tasks in R than a general purpose programming language.

---

# Why R?

The R community is one of R's greatest assets, being vibrant, inclusive and supportive of users at all levels.

# Why R?

R Markdown is sometimes called R's "killer feature". Turns analyses into fully reproducible high quality reports, presentations and dashboards.

Can run Python and other languages in R Markdown documents

# Module overview

Chosen topics are: 

-  foundational
-  follow stages 1 and 2 well
-  are widely applicable (in this module and beyond) 
-  transferable conceptually

We cover:

-  Using RStudio projects and an emphasis on good practice for code and project documentation and organisation
-  More advanced data tidying
-  An emphasis on reproducibility and reproducible reporting using R Markdown.
-  Some commonly applied machine learning methods

---
# Week plan

# Approach and Assessment

You will
-  learn essential skills for reproducible and open research but otherwise......
-  work on problems you are interested in and/or that are related to project or module work

Thus there is choice and flexibility in the assessment. Two highly scoring submissions could look completely different.

---
# The options

1. Reproducible analysis related to your project/module work
   * Analysis of existing or simulated data including images
   * Conversion of existing lab tools (eg excel files) to reproducible pipelines
   * Analysis of literature (text analysis)
2. Reproducible analysis of previous work undertaken unreproducibly
   * 58I Bioscience Techniques - almost all of the analyses undertaken (use of excel, Summit, ImageJ etc) can be coded reproducibly.
3. Reproducible analysis of a provided project - because not everyone enjoys choosing their own

]
In your assessment you **must** use RStudio projects and rmarkdown (any, incl. Shiny), organise your analyses for reproducibility and follow good practice.

--

The extent of data tidying and processing and machine learning methods will vary depending on your project.
