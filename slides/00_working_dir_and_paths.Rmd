# Introduction

## Aims

The aim of this section is to show you what is meant by a working directory and a path.

## Learning outcomes 

The successful student will be able to:

* understand what is meant by working directory, absolute and relative paths
* find and change their current working directory
* list files in their current working directory

### `r emo::ji("clapper")` An instruction to do something!!

#  What is a path?


---
# What is a path?

A path gives the location of a filesystem object (i.e., a file, directory or link).

A path can be **absolute** or **relative**

--

## Absolute paths

An Absolute path is given from the root directory of the object. 

For example the absolute path for a file, `beewing.txt` can be:  
  * windows: `M:/web/58M_BDS_2019/data/beewing.txt`  <sup>1</sup>

.footnote[
1. this appears as `M:\web\58M_BDS_2019\data\beewing.txt` in Windows Explorer because Microsoft DOS didn't have directories in 1981 when it was released. It then used the `/` character for 'switches' (instead of the unix convention `-`)
]
--

  * unix systems: `/users/er13/web/58M_BDS_2019/data/beewing.txt`  
--

  * web: `http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~er13/58M_BDS_2019/data/beewing.txt`  

---
# What is a path?

## Relative paths

A relative path gives the location of a filesystem object relative to the working directory.

A working directory is where a program thinks you are and is returned by `getwd()` in R.

--

For example when `beewing.txt` is in:  
  * the working directory (wd):  `beewing.txt`  
--

  * a directory called 'data' which is in the wd: `data/beewing.txt`  
--

  * the directory above the wd: `../beewing.txt`  
--

  * a directory called 'data' which is in the directory above the wd: `../data/beewing.txt`  

---
# What is a path?


## Demonstration

```
-- thursday
   |__beewing.txt
   |__below_thursday
   |__data
      |__pigeon.txt
```
