# Task 1 New project, without collaboration, GitHub first

This exercise allows you to practice a workflow for a version controlled  RStudio Project which exists on your machine and on GitHub. It is suitable when you are the only person contributing to the project.

The data in [chaff.txt](../data-raw/chaff.txt) are the masses of male and female chaffinches. It is organised in to two columns, `males` and `females` a format which is not normally ideal. Your task is to organise a version controlled analysis of these data.

You need to:

1. Do the New project, GitHub first workflow
   * Make a new repo on GitHub and initialise with a README and license  
   * Clone the repo into a RStudio Project on your own machine  

2. Paste the address of your GitHub repo to the chat.  

3. Create a directory structure suitable for the analysis - you may wish to revise this later as you work.  

4. Import and reformat the data into 'tidy' form, i.e., one column giving the sex, another giving the mass. Write the newly formatted data to a file.  A dataframe can be written to file using, for example:
```{r eval=FALSE}
file <-  "../daw-processed/chaff2.txt"
write.table(chaff2, 
            file, 
            quote = FALSE,
            row.names = FALSE)
```

5. Summarise and analyse the data testing whether there is a difference in mass between male and female chaffinches

6. Stage and commit all the changes you have made using an appropriate commit message. 

7. Create a report-worthy figure for the analysis and write it to file. A useful function for saving **`ggplot2`** figures is [`ggsave()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html). It has arguments for the size, resolution and device for the image. Since I often make more than one figure, I might set these argument values to variables first:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# figure saving settings
units <- "in"  
fig_w <- 3.5
fig_h <- fig_w
dpi <- 300
device <- "tiff" 
```
Then write the figure to file using, for example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggsave("../figures/fig1.tiff",
       plot = fig1,
       device = device,
       width = fig_w,
       height = fig_h,
       units = units,
       dpi = dpi)
```

8. Stage and commit all the changes you have made using an appropriate commit message. Push your changes to GitHub

9. Reconsider the organisation of your code and project.
   * Would some pieces of code be better in their own script?  
   * Is your code well commented? Are your variable names informative? See chapters 1 and 2 of [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for more suggestions.  

10. Stage and commit any changes you have made using an appropriate commit message. Push your changes to GitHub

11. Go to your GitHub repo, make some changes to the README and commit them.

12. Go to back to your local repo and Pull the changes in.

<font size = "4">
`r emo::ji("exclamation_mark")` Start every work session with a pull to make sure you are up-to-date. If you are working alone or only with the original repo and one clone, it is often not needed but it is a good habit to get into early.

use particular columns `select()`

summarising data the tidyverse way

# Task 2 

Tidy the data given in [Human-development-index.csv](../data-raw/Human-development-index.csv) so that all the indices are in a single column with other columns giving the rank, country and year.



# Task 3 Case study

1. Add a column, `protid`, for the top protein identifier. This is the first Uniprot ID after the "1::" in the `accession` column. 

```{r}
# trying it out on one value
accession <- sol$accession[2]
str_extract(accession, "1::[^;]+") %>% 
  str_replace("1::", "")

# adding a new column 
sol <- sol %>%
  mutate(protid =  str_extract(accession, "1::[^;]+") %>% 
           str_replace("1::", ""))

            
```



2. Create a second dataframe, `sol2` in which the protein abundances are in a single column, `abundance` and the cell lineage and replicate, `lineage_rep`, is indicated in another. All the other variables should also be in the new data frame. 
```{r}
sol2 <- sol %>% pivot_longer(names_to = "lineage_rep",
                             values_to = "abundance",
                             cols = starts_with("y"))


```


3. Create separate columns in `sol2` for the cell lineage and the replicate.
```{r}
sol2 <- sol2 %>%
  extract(lineage_rep,
          c("line", "rep"),
          "(y[0-9]{3,4})\\_([a-c])")
```

4. Write `sol2` to file
```{r}

```
