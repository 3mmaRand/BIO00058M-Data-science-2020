# Week Overview

## Aim
The aim of this session is to introduce you to good programming practice and the use of R Markdown for creating reproducible analyses.

## Objectives
By the end of this week the successful student should be able to:

-  organise and document code effectively
-  follow good practice in code styling
-  create user-defined functions and call them
-  create simple R Markdown documents
-  explain what R Markdown is
-  appreciate the role of the YAML header
-  set default code chunk behaviour and those for individual chunks
-  use headings and simple text formatting

# Task 1

This task will give you an opportunity to use R Markdown but also to continue practising organisation and tidying.

In the workshop for [Topic 1: Project organisation](01_project_organisation.html) you worked with data in [chaff.txt](../data-raw/chaff.txt) which are the masses of male and female chaffinches.

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Open the RStudio Project you created for that exercise. The instructions were to call this `chaffinches`. If you cannot find your own, you can use my version: [BIO00058M-chaffinches-w01](https://github.com/3mmaRand/BIO00058M-chaffinches-w01)

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Create an R Markdown document for reporting on the data. I suggest calling it "main.Rmd". You may want to refer to the [slides](../slides/03_repro_and_intro_to_rmarkdown.html).

   -  Delete everything except the YAML header and the first code chunk called `setup` 
   -  Edit the YAML:
      -  Add your name and a title  
      -  Use the **`bookdown`** package `r Cite(myBib, "bookdown")`  for output types which handle cross referencing well. We will do cross referencing in the next Topic. 

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Set some **default** code chunk options. I recommend these:
````
```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                     warning = FALSE,
                     message = FALSE,
                     fig.retina = 3)
```
````
`r emo::ji("clapper")` Insert a code chunk (Ctrl + Alt + I) for package loading:
````
```{r packages}`r ''`
source("R/00-pkg.R")
```
````

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Run the code chunk.


`r emo::ji("clapper")` Add headings for Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion and add a sentence to each of the Introduction and Methods.

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Now add a code chunk for importing and tidying the data. Make sure you follow the guidance in the [slides](../slides/03_repro_and_intro_to_rmarkdown.html) for organising and styling your code. 

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Run the code chunk. You should have a dataframe of the chaffinch data, in a tidy format, in your environment.

You are now going to write a function for calculating the $SS(x)$ of all the mass values. You will be able to call it with `sum_sq(chaff_tidy$mass)`.

`r emo::ji("clapper")` First open a script called `sum_sq.R` for editing:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
usethis::use_r("sum_sq")
```

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Now define the function. If you are not sure how to do that, don't worry, it was given in the [independent study slides](https://3mmarand.github.io/BIO00058M-Data-science-2020/slides/03_repro_and_intro_to_rmarkdown.html#32)


`r emo::ji("clapper")` Check your function works sourcing it and then calling it.
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
sum_sq(chaff_tidy$mass)
```

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Adapt the `02-summarise.R` script so it sources and calls `sum_sq`. Then add a code chunk to `Main.Rmd` which sources `02-summarise.R`.

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Add a code chunk to `Main.Rmd` that runs the plotting code.

# Task 2
Turn your work on the Case study of the proteomic data from five immortalised mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) lines into an Rmd.  That was covered here [Task 3 Topic 2](02_tidying_data.html#Task_3).



# The code files
These contain all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not visible on the webpage.
[Rmd file](03_repro_and_intro_to_rmarkdown.Rmd) The Rmd file is the file I use to compile the practical. Rmd stands for R markdown. It allows R code and ordinary text to be interweaved to produce well-formatted reports including webpages. If you right-click on the link and choose Save-As, you will be able to open the Rmd file in RStudio. Alternatively, [View in Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/BIO00058M-Data-science-2020/blob/master/workshops/03_repro_and_intro_to_rmarkdown.Rmd).


Pages made with `rmarkdown` `r Cite(myBib, c("markdown1","markdown2", "markdown3"))`, `RefManageR``r Cite(myBib, "RefManageR")`
