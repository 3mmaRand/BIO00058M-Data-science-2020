# Task 1  ** to be completed**

In [Topic 3: Reproducibility and an introduction to R Markdown, Task 1 ](03_repro_and_intro_to_rmarkdown.html#Task_1) you worked with data in [chaff.txt](../data-raw/chaff.txt) which are the masses of male and female chaffinches.

1. Open that project and the Rmd you made last topic
2. Paste the address of your GitHub repo to the chat.  `r emo::ji("speech_balloon")` if you haven't already. This helps me see how you are getting on.
3. As you work, stage and commit all the changes you have made using an appropriate commit message. Periodically pull (for developing a habit) and then push your changes to GitHub

 ** to be completed**

# Task 2
Turn your work on the Case study of the proteomic data from five immortalised mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) lines into an Rmd.  That was covered here [Task 3 Topic 2](02_tidying_data.html#Task_3).
