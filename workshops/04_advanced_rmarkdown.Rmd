# Week Overview

## Aim
The aim of this session is to introduce you to more advanced features of R Markdown for creating reproducible analyses including special characters, inline code, referencing, tables and cross referencing sections, figures and tables.

## Objectives
By the end of this week the successful student should be able to:

-  use inline code in an Rmd to report outputs of analysis
-  insert special characters and mathematical expressions into an Rmd with LaTeX
-  add automatically numbered and cross referenced figures to knitted outputs
-  add citations and a reference list to knitted output


# Task 1

In [Topic 3: Reproducibility and an introduction to R Markdown, Task 1 ](03_repro_and_intro_to_rmarkdown.html#Task_1) you worked with data in [chaff.txt](../data-raw/chaff.txt) which are the masses of male and female chaffinches.

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Open that RStudio Project and the Rmd you made last topic. As you work, periodically knit your Rmd to html. 

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Search for one or two references that you could use in a short introduction. Obtain the references in BibTeX form, create a .bib file for your references and add it to your YAML header. Cite those references in the introduction and add a header `# References` to the end of your rmd.

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Add figures for photographs of male and female chaffinches that you reference in the introduction. Wikipedia is a good source of images. Ensure your figure is numbered and has a figure legend.

`r emo::ji("clapper")`  Undertake an appropriate statistical analysis to determine if there is a significant difference between males and females in mass.

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Report summary information and test results in the knitted output.

`r emo::ji("clapper")`  Add a figure to illustrate the results ensuring it is numbered and has a figure legend.

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Create your own ggplot theme. You can achieve this by:

-  examining the code for theme_gray() (the default) by typing `theme_gray` without the brackets  
-  copying and saving the code theme_gray in its own script called, for example, theme_emma.R  
-  changing theme elements as you wish  
-  sourcing your theme script and applying in the same way as you would apply another ggplot theme. 

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Go through your Rmd checking your code is well-commented and formatted, and you have followed good practice from previous workshops.

`r emo::ji("clapper")` Great news, we've got data for another few individuals! They have been added to the data in [more_chaff.txt](../data-raw/more_chaff.txt). Update your output.

# Task 2
Continue to work on the Case study of the proteomic data from five immortalised mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) lines.  That was covered here [Task 3 Topic 2](02_tidying_data.html#Task_3).


# The code files
These contain all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not visible on the webpage.
[Rmd file](04_advanced_rmarkdown.Rmd) The Rmd file is the file I use to compile the practical. Rmd stands for R markdown. It allows R code and ordinary text to be interweaved to produce well-formatted reports including webpages. If you right-click on the link and choose Save-As, you will be able to open the Rmd file in RStudio. Alternatively, [View in Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/BIO00058M-Data-science-2020/blob/master/workshops/04_advanced_rmarkdown.Rmd).


Pages made with `rmarkdown` `r Cite(myBib, c("markdown1","markdown2", "markdown3"))`, `RefManageR``r Cite(myBib, "RefManageR")`
