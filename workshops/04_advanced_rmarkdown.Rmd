# Task 1

In [Topic 3: Reproducibility and an introduction to R Markdown, Task 1 ](03_repro_and_intro_to_rmarkdown.html#Task_1) you worked with data in [chaff.txt](../data-raw/chaff.txt) which are the masses of male and female chaffinches.

1. Open that RStudio Project and the Rmd you made last topic. As you work, periodically knit your Rmd to html. If you did not previously create a separate version controlled RStudio Project for the chaffinch data analysis, do so now.
2. For those that have not yet posted their GitHub page to the chat, please do that now.  
3. As you work, stage and commit all the changes you have made using an appropriate commit message. Periodically pull (for developing a habit) and then push your changes to GitHub.  
4. Search for one or two references that you could use in a short introduction. Obtain the references in BibTeX form, create a .bib file for your references and add it to your YAML header. Cite those references in the introduction and add a header `# References` to the end of your rmd.
5. Add figures for photographs of male and female chaffinches that you reference in the introduction. Wikipedia is a good source of images. Ensure your figure is numbered and has a figure legend.
6. Undertake an appropriate statistical analysis to determine if there is a significant difference between males and females in mass.
7. Report summary information and test results in the knitted output.
8. Add a figure to illustrate the results ensuring it is numbered and has a figure legend.
9. Create your own ggplot theme. You can achieve this by:  
    * examining the code for theme_gray() (the default) by typing `theme_gray` without the brackets  
    * copying and saving the code theme_gray in its own script called, for example, theme_emma.R  
    * changing theme elements as you wish  
    * sourcing your theme script and applying in the same way as you would apply another ggplot theme. 
10. Go through your Rmd checking your code is well-commented and formatted, and you have followed good practice from previous workshops.
11. Great news, we've got data for another few individuals! They have been added to the data in [more_chaff.txt](../data-raw/more_chaff.txt). Update your output.

# Task 2
Continue to work on the Case study of the proteomic data from five immortalised mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) lines.  That was covered here [Task 3 Topic 2](02_tidying_data.html#Task_3).
